/*
	This file contains the logic to create cards.
	While cards are described in an object form, they are always converted to a class equivalent.

	You can find cards themselves in content/cards.js

	Cards can _optionally_ define an array of actions named `actions`. These actions will be run when the card is played.
	In the same way, you can define a list of `conditions` that have to pass for the card to be playable.
	Your "actions" actions can ALSO define a list of conditions.
